\subsection*{a}
Search path to $q$ at $D_j$ becomes longer if $q$ is in a trapezoid that was just
created by the latest insertion. We also know that at most 4 line segments define
that trapezoids. Thus, the probability the search part becomes longer is :
$$
Pr[\text{Search Path to $q$ become longer at step $i$}] = 4/i
$$

Hence, the expected length of the search part increases when comparing at step $j$ and $k$
where $j<k$ is:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Expected Length} &\leq \sum_{i=j}^{k}( 4/i ) \\
    &\leq 4( \sum_{i=1}^{k}( 1/i ) -  \sum_{i=1}^{j}( 1/i ) ) \\
    &\leq 4( 1 + \log_{e}k - 1 - log_{e}j ) \\
    &\leq O(\log(k/j))
\end{align*}
