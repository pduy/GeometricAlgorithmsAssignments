\subsection*{a}
Search path to $q$ at $D_j$ becomes longer if $q$ is in a trapezoid that was just
created by the latest insertion. We also know that at most 4 line segments define
that trapezoids. Thus, the probability the search part becomes longer is :
$$
Pr[\text{Search Path to $q$ become longer at step $i$}] = 4/i
$$

Hence, the expected length of the search part increases when comparing at step $j$ and $k$
where $j<k$ is:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Expected Length} &\leq \sum_{i=j}^{k}( 4/i ) \\
    &= 4( \sum_{i=1}^{k}( 1/i ) -  \sum_{i=1}^{j}( 1/i ) ) \\
    &= 4( 1 + \log_{e}k - 1 - log_{e}j ) \\
    &= O(\log(k/j))
\end{align*}

Therefore, the expected time locating $q$ at $D_k$ is $O(\log(k/j))$.

\subsection*{b}
We observe that vertical decomposition lines will intersect properly with $P$ if 
the edges that they intersect with have not added into $T$ yet. Hence,
the probability that $T_j$ have proper intersection with $P$ is :

$$
Pr[\text{Proper Intersection between $T_j$ and $P$} ] = (n-j)/(n-1)
$$

Thus, the expected number of proper intersection, $E$, between $T_j$ and $P$ is :

\begin{align*}
    \text{E} &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}(n-i)/(n-1) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n-1}\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \\
    &= \frac{n-2}{2} \\
    &= O(n)
\end{align*}
