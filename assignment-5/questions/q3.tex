For each edge $pq$ in EMST of $P$, the circle that has $pq$ as a diameter will not contain any point inside.
Hence, all edges in EMST are valid in $Gabiel$ of $P$.

To prove the statement, we suppose there is a point $k$ inside the circle built by $pq$ in EMST.
$pk$ and $qk$ will become smaller than $pq$. Thus, $pq$ will not be longer exist in EMST.
As a result, both $Gabriel$ and EMTS will not contain $pq$.
