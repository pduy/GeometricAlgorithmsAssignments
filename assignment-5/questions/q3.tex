\subsection*{a}
In this section, we have to prove that the edge set of the EMST of $P$ contains the edges of a nearest neighbor graph.\\

Assume that there is an edge between the points $ a $ and $ b $ of the nearest neighbor graph which is not in the EMST, then we could replace the edge containing $a$ by $ab$ in the tree and that will decrease the total edge length of the EMST, because the current edge containing $a$ is longer than $ab$. So the EMST is not EMST. This contradiction proves the statement.

\subsection*{b}
In this section, we have to prove that the set of edges of the Gabiel graph of $P$ contains and EMST of $P$. \\

Assume that the edge set of the Gabiel graph does not contain an EMST of $P$, which means there is an edge $pq$ in the EMST that is not in the Gabiel graph. \\

This implies there is a point $k$ inside the circle taking $pq$ as the diameter. Hence,
$pk$ and $qk$ will become smaller than $pq$. Thus, $pq$ is not a valid edge of the EMST.
This contradiction proves the statement.

\subsection*{c}
Suppose that the Delaunay graph of $P$ does not contain the Gabriel graph of $P$, which means there are a pair of points ${p, q}$ that are not in the same triangle, but the circle $c$ taking $pq$ as the diameter is empty. We will prove that the triangles containing $p$ and $q$ are illegal. \\

Indeed, let $q_1, q_2$ be the points in the same triangle with $q$. We know that the circle $c$ is empty, so both $q_1$ and $q_2$ are outside of $c$. Thus, the 
circumcircle of $\bigtriangleup q_1 q q_2$ is bigger than $c$, which implies that its diameter is larger than $pq$. Then, this circumcircle contains $p$. So $\bigtriangleup q_1 q q_2$ is not a valid triangle. \\

Similarly, we can prove that the triangle containing $p$ is also invalid. Thus, the graph is not the Delaunay graph anymore. \\

By contradiction, we have just proven that the Delaunay graph of $P$ contains the Gabiel graph of $P$.
